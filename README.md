  * **MULTIPLE CHOICE**
 
  * 1.What does documentation of type of care, time of care, and signature of the person prove?
 
* |  |  |
* | --- | --- |
* | a. | The person who signed the documentation did all the work noted. |
* | b. | No litigation can be brought against the person who signed. |
* | c. | Interventions were implemented to meet the patient’s needs. |
* | d. | The patient’s response to the intervention was positive. |

ANS: C

Documenting type of care, time of care, and signature of the person results in recording the interventions that are implemented to meet the patient’s needs. Many charting entries include doctor’s visits, presence of family, or interventions by other departments. Patient response to some interventions is not always positive.

Cost reimbursement rates by government plans (Medicare, Medicaid) are based on the prospective payment system of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs); a system that classifies patients by age, diagnosis, surgical procedure, and other information with hundreds of different categories to predict the use of hospital resources, including length of stay, resulting in a fixed payment amount.

30.A nurse is receiving a telephone order from a physician. The nurse uses a safety measure of preventing errors that is recognized by The Joint Commission as one method of meeting National Patient Safety Goals. What is the correct order of this method?

a. Read back

b. Background

c. Recommendation

d. Situation

e. Assessment

ANS:

D, B, E, C, A

SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation) is a method of communication among health care workers and a part of documentation (Kaiser Permanente, 2007). SBAR is considered a safety measure in preventing errors from poor communication during “hand-off” or “handover” interactions, the communication that occurs from one shift to the next or when a nurse phones a health care provider with information about a patient. An additional “R” is added. The additional “R” (SBARR) represents “read back” when the nurse reads back the order for clarification.
